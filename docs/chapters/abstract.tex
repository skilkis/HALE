The purpose of this assignment is to model the wing of a HALE UAV using a
typical section approach. Of importance to this analysis is the selected
location of the typical section, which is obtained through the use of natural
frequency based optimization. Furthermore, the stability boundaries are
assessed using a structural model along with four aerodynamic models that are
coupled in a state-space representation. A clear result of this analysis is
that the flow is highly unsteady and cannot be represented with a quasi-steady
aerodynamic model. Finally, the effect of wingbox parameters on the stability
boundaries are examined and the wingbox is optimized for matching the flutter
to the divergence speed. The enabler of this assignment and analysis is an
Object-Oriented Python code that is capable of running optimizations on Finite
Element Meshes. This code is planned to be open sourced after the deadline and
will be available at \url{https://github.com/skilkis/HALE}.
