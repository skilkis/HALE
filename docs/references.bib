  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of an advanced, conceptual wing-box weight estimation and sizing model for transport aircraft. The model is based on linear thin-walled beam theory, where the wing-box is modelled as a simple, swept tapered multi-element beam. It consists of three coupled modules, namely sizing, aeroelastic analysis, and weight prediction. The sizing module performs generic wing-box sizing using a multi-element strategy. Three design cases are considered for each wing-box element. The aeroelastic analysis module accounts for static aeroelastic requirements and estimates their impact on the wing-box sizing. The weight prediction module estimates the wing-box weight based on the sizing process, including static aeroelastic requirements. The breakdown of the models into modules increases its flexibility for future enhancements to cover complex wing geometries and advanced aerospace materials. The model has been validated using five different transport aircraft. It has shown to be sufficiently robust, yielding an error bandwidth of ±3\%, an average error estimate of -0·2\%, and a standard error estimate of 1·5\%.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the trade-off between active loads alleviation through trailing edge flaps and passive loads alleviation through bending-twisting coupling. Both loads alleviation methods have conflicting requirements for optimal effectiveness. Therefore it is of interest to trade them off in an optimisation context. A dedicated aeroservoelastic model is developed that quickly can assess gust loads in the presence of flaps and bending-twisting coupling. This model is based on a linear Euler beam closely coupled to a Theodorsen unsteady aerodynamics model that is converted to time domain using the indicial functions method of Leishman. It is demonstrated in this paper that a combination of active and passive loads alleviation outperforms separate loads alleviation methods. I.

  abstract = {This paper considers the selection of structural shape bases for the modelling of flexible beams using the nonlinear beam shapes formulation. The approach provides a low order geometrically nonlinear representation of a flexible beam using a kinematic description that is geometrically exact; a minimal state representation is achieved by projecting the problem onto a set of shape functions spanning the beam. Motivated by the requirements for the low-order modelling of aeroelastic systems, this study examines the practical requirements of applying these shape sets to a flexible wing problem. A number of candidate shape sets are presented: orthogonal and nonorthogonal, with and without load dependent boundary conditions. The efficiency with which this problem is solved is used to assess the performance of each candidate shape set and infer the common properties between the most efficient bases. For a system with a moderate number of states a fairly consistent performance is observed across all of the sets. For larger sized problems, orthogonality of the shape basis is required to ensure robustness and scalability. It is shown that for a generic basis set the necessary boundary conditions of the problem can be easily satisfied, furthermore any orthogonal properties of a chosen basis can be retained. This concept is extended to allow for the treatment of more complex configurations starting from a simple shape basis.},

  abstract = {Indicial approximations are derived for the lift on an airfoil penetrating a stationary sharp-edge gust in two-dimensional subsonic flow. Using an assumed exponential form, the approximations have been generalized in terms of Mach number alone by means of an optimization algorithm where certain coefficients of the approximations are free parameters, The optimization is subject to prescribed constraints in terms of the initial and asymptotic behavior of the gust response, and by requiring the response closely match the known exact solutions given by subsonic linear theory at earlier values of time. An alternative approximation is obtained by using results from a direct numerical simulation of the gust problem using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), For an airfoil-vortex interaction problem, comparisons were made with experimental data and CFD results. Finally, the indicial method was integrated into a three-dimensional rotor simulation, and the near- and far-field acoustics were computed using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkins equation. Good agreement was found with simultaneously measured airloads and acoustics data.},

These large static deflections can change the natural frequencies of the wing, which, in turn, can produce significant changes in its aeroelastic behavior. This behavior can be accounted for only by using a rigorous nonlinear aeroelastic analysis. Results are obtained from such an analysis for aeroelastic behavior as well as overall flight dynamic characteristics of a complete aircraft model representative of HALE aircraft. When the nonlinear flexibility effects are taken into account in the calculation of trim and flight dynamics characteristics, the predicted aeroelastic behavior of the complete aircraft turns out to be very different from what it would be without such effects.},
